# legsim guide

this guide explains how to set up a legsim chamber and the basic process of passing legislation. 

this assumes you have already have legsim running and have a system user account. see the [setup.md](setup.md) for more information.

## create a course

log in as a system user. go to "Courses" > "Create New Course". fill in the form and click "Create Course".

## create a chamber

on the course page, click "Create New Chamber". fill in the form and click "Create Chamber". you should now see the chamber on the course page.

## create a student user

copy the chamber's "Member Code" from the course page. go to the user sign in page at `/users/sign_in`. click "Create New Account" and fill in the form. Use the "Member Code" from earlier for the "Chamber Authorization Code" field.

the sign up button may not work so you may have to press enter inside a text field to submit the form.

if you get an error when signing up, you may have to manually confirm the user. in the system menu, go to the "Users" tab, click on the chamber, find the user, and click "Manage". there should be a button to "Manually Confirm User".

the student user should now be able to log in and do normal legislative stuff.

## create an administrator user

in order to actually progress legislation, you will need access to the leader's desk.

creating an administrator user is similar to creating a student user, except you will have to use the "Administrator Code" instead of the "Member Code" when signing up.

once the administrator user is logged in, you can access the leader's desk under "Floor". Note that the leader's desk is also referred to as "Chamber Management" in some pages.

## make a student user the chamber leader

only administrators can access the leader's desk by default, but administrators can assign a student user to be the chamber leader, giving them access as well.

in a classroom setting, you may want students to nominate their chamber leader. they can do this by going to "Clerk" > "Chamber Leadership".

to actually assign a chamber leader, go to "Floor" > "Leader's Desk" > "Committee/Chamber Management". committee leaders can be assigned here as well, giving them the ability to manage individual committees.

## creating legislation

students can create and submit legislation by going to "Clerk" > "Submit Legislation". Once submitted, legislation will be visible in "Clerk" > "Browse Legislation".

## referring legislation to committee

the leader can refer legislation to committees by going to "Floor" > "Leader's Desk" > "Committee Referrals". Note that you have to actually click on the legislation name (it will be highlighted in blue) to select it.

## passing legislation through committee

either the chamber leader or a committee leader can do this step.

committee leaders can directly access their committee by "Committees" > "Committee on X". the chamber leader can access all committees from "Committees" > "Committees Directory" > "Committee on X"

once on the committee page, click "Manage Committee". "Step 1: Open a hearing on the bill"
